# `PicoSDK-NoStatic-Bindgen`
Welcome to `PicoSDK-NoStatic-Bindgen` ðŸŽ‰

This is a helper tool to generate no-`static` no-`inline` wrappers around the public `static inline` functions within
the SDK.

## Word of Warning
We use regex to parse the C headers â€“ so this tool is horribly cursed by definition. It is recommended to cross-check
the generated wrapper.
